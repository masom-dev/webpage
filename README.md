## Add a new event

Here are the steps to add a new event with git:

```
Clone the repository locally :
git clone https://github.com/Boston-area-Women-in-Bioinformatics/webpage.git
# List branches in a github repos :
git branch
# Be in main branch if not already
git checkout main
# Create a new branch :
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

After you enter a new branch, you need to create a markdown file in the `src/content/meetups` directory.

The markdown file should follow a specific format. In between the top two `---` you must fill out the event parameters. Everything below the second `---` can be in markdown format. Look at the other markdown files for reference. The metadata should include fields like `title`, `dateTime`, `location`, `url`, `image`, `tags`, and `imgpos`. The `imgpos` parameter is for the css on the main events page. See https://tailwindcss.com/docs/object-position for options. `tags` are not currently in use, but may be in the future.

To add an image, upload it to the `public/photos` directory of your cloned repository. The image should be referenced in the markdown file using the `image` field in the metadata.

After creating the markdown file and uploading the image, you can run the following commands to format the files and commit your changes:

```
# Run 'npx --prettier' to fix any astro specific formatting issues
npx prettier --write src/content/meetups/{newevent}.md
# Stage the changes to commit :
git add /public/photos/<your_image_name>
git add src/content/meetups/{newevent}.md
#  Commit new changes
git push -u origin <new-branch-name>
```

## Add a new blog post

Here are the steps to add a new blogpost with git:

```
Clone the repository locally :
git clone https://github.com/Boston-area-Women-in-Bioinformatics/webpage.git
# List branches in a github repos :
git branch
# Be in main branch if not already
git checkout main
# Create a new branch :
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

After you enter a new branch, you need to create a markdown file in the `src/content/post` directory.

The markdown file should follow a specific format. In between the top two `---` you must fill out the parameters for the blog post. Everything below the second `---` can be in markdown format. Look at the other markdown files for reference. The parameters include:

- `publishDate`: date when the blog post was published, in ISO format (YYYY-MM -DDTHH:mm:ssZ)
- `title`: name of the blog post
- `slug`: a unique identifier for the blog post, used in the URL
- `excerpt`: appears on the website front page to describe the post
- `image`: path to the image that will be displayed on the blog post page
- author information:
  - `author`: name of the SINGLE author of the blog post
  - `authorUrl`: URL to the author's LinkedIn profile
  - `authors`: list of authors if there are multiple authors, each with their name and LinkedIn URL
- `category`: category of the blog post, e.g., "Podcast", "Deep Dive", "Quick Take"
- `tags`: list of tags associated with the blog post, e.g., "bioinformatics", "career-advice", "software-engineering"
- `metadata`: additional metadata for SEO, including `title`, `description`, and `canonical` URL
- `listeningTime`: length of time of podcast written out (optional, only for podcast posts)

To add an image, upload it to the `public/photos` directory of your cloned repository. The image should be referenced in the markdown file using the `image` field in the metadata.

After creating the markdown file and uploading the image, you can run the following commands to format the files and commit your changes:

```
# Run 'npx --prettier' to fix any astro specific formatting issues
npx prettier --write src/content/post/{newblog}.md
# Stage the changes to commit :
git add /public/photos/<your_image_name>
git add src/content/post/{newblog}.md
#  Commit new changes
git push -u origin <new-branch-name>
```

## Add a new newsletter

Here are the steps to add a new newsletter with git:

```
Clone the repository locally :
git clone https://github.com/Boston-area-Women-in-Bioinformatics/webpage.git
# List branches in a github repos :
git branch
# Be in main branch if not already
git checkout main
# Create a new branch :
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

After you enter a new branch, you need to create a markdown file in the `src/content/newsletter` directory.

The markdown file should follow a specific format. In between the top two `---` you must fill out the parameters for the blog post. Everything below the second `---` can be in markdown format. Look at the other markdown files for reference. The parameters include:

- `publishDate`: date when the blog post was published, in ISO format (YYYY-MM -DDTHH:mm:ssZ)
- `title`: name of the blog post
- `excerpt`: appears on the website front page to describe the post
- `image`: path to the image that will be displayed on the blog post page
- `authors`: list of authors if there are multiple authors, each with their name and LinkedIn URL
- `metadata`: additional metadata for SEO, including `title`, `description`, and `canonical` URL

To add an image, upload it to the `public/photos` directory of your cloned repository. The image should be referenced in the markdown file using the `image` field in the metadata.

After creating the markdown file and uploading the image, you can run the following commands to format the files and commit your changes:

```
# Run 'npx --prettier' to fix any astro specific formatting issues
npx prettier --write src/content/post/{newblog}.md
# Stage the changes to commit :
git add /public/photos/<your_image_name>
git add src/content/post/{newblog}.md
#  Commit new changes
git push -u origin <new-branch-name>
```

### Newsletter template

To modify the newsletter template, go to `src/components/newsletter/SinglePost.astro`.

If you want to add a header image that appears on every newsletter, you can add it in the `SinglePost.astro` file just below the author information section.

If you want to add parameters to the newsletter markdown files, such as "issue number", you will need to also do the following:

- add the new parameter to `newsLetterCollection` in `src/content/config.ts`
- add the new parameter to the `Newsletter` type in `src/types.d.ts`
- modify `getNormalizedNewsletter` function in `src/utils/newsletter.ts` to handle the new parameter.

# Create a new branch :

```

## Update the banner that appears on every page

To add or remove the banner, go to `src/layouts/PageLayout.astro` and add or remove the following lines respectively:

```
<slot name="banner">
  <Banner client:load />
</slot>
```

To edit the banner, go to `src/components/Banner.jsx` and edit the text inside the `<p>` tag. You can also change the text and link in the `<a>` tag to point to a different page.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

### Website images

Most images can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation.

Team member photos/avatars for the team page should go in `public/team/`. To add a member to the team page, please modify `src/config/components/team.js` and set the "avatar" setting to the path of the member's photo. The path should be in the format `/team/{image_name}`. See other entries as examples. You can also use an image from another website as an avatar image.

Logos are found in the `src/assets/favicons` directory.

Icon images are found in the `src/assets/images` directory.

### 🔔 Upcoming: AstroWind 2.0 – We Need Your Vision!

We're embarking on an exciting journey with **AstroWind 2.0**, and we want you to be a part of it! We're currently taking the first steps in developing this new version and your insights are invaluable. Join the discussion and share your feedback, ideas, and suggestions to help shape the future of **AstroWind**. Let's make **AstroWind 2.0** even better, together!

[Share Your Feedback in Our Discussion!](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind/discussions/392)

<br>

### Getting started with AstroWind

**AstroWind** tries to give you quick access to creating a website using [Astro 4.0](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a free theme which focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

Very little vanilla javascript is used only to provide basic functionality so that each developer decides which framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid JS...) to use and how to approach their goals.

In this version the template supports all the options in the `output` configuration, `static`, `hybrid` and `server`, but the blog only works with `prerender = true`. We are working on the next version and aim to make it fully compatible with SSR.
